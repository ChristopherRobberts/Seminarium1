            <h1>How to make them</h1>
            <p>
              A rich pancake, like those often served in Sweden, takes the proportions
                 of a standard pancake and skews them, boosting the proportion of eggs,
                 butter and sugar at the expense of flour. As with brownies or cookies,
                 when you increase fat and sweetness and decrease filler (a k a flour),
                 the results are indisputably better, and thanks to beaten egg whites
                 supremely light and airy. Don't stir the batter any more than is
                 necessary to combine the ingredients; it will make the pancakes tough.
                 Cook them, over fairly high heat, in a lot of butter. These are so rich
                 and delicious they can be served with nothing more than a dusting of
                 confectioners sugar. But they are sweet enough so that you can serve
                 them with lingonberry or other tart preserves or even a little lemon
                 juice. Yogurt or sour cream also complement the pancakes nicely.
